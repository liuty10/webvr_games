By fusing at particular point, user will be teleported to that location. I have added some event driven sounds and timer component.

# Device motion controller:

This is a simple demo on how can we use device motion to control the objects in the screen. After putting the goggles, jump in real and the ball will bounce on the screen.

# Motion controller game pad:

This demo will be more about connecting a motion controller like Wii Remote to a game. In this example, I am trying to throw a ball with some force based on the motion of controller. The work is still in progress.
